## Before you begin

1. Create a new iOS project
2. Call it "Animal Kingdom Basic"
3. Save the project
4. Download [Images](https://github.com/alimir1/animal-kingdom-basic/tree/master/Animal%20Images)

## Required features and components
* Three buttons with images of monkey, elephant, and a tiger. When user taps on either of the button, the label underneeth displays the name of the selected animal. You can download the images [here](https://github.com/alimir1/animal-kingdom-basic/tree/master/Animal%20Images).
* A label underneeth the images that tells the user what animal was selected.
* A segmented control with options: white, red, green, and blue. When user taps on either of the control, the background color changes appropriately.
* A label that displays font size of the label above (that displays name of the selected animal)
* A slider next to the font-size label that users can slide to increase or decrease the size of the above label.
* A switch button that hides the font slider when it is on, and doesn't hide it when it is off.
* At the start of the app, "Monkey" appears to be selected. That means that image of monkey is "monkey filled" and text of the label underneeth says "Monkey".
* When the user selects an image of an animal, the SELECTED image should change it's own image to filled and all other button images change to unfilled mode. Ex: If I tap tiger's image, tiger's image is now filled mode and other animals (monkey and lion) appear to be outlined images.
